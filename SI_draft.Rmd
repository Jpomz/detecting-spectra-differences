# $\lambda$ and relationship estimates

In the main analysis, we simulate body size data from bounded power law distributions while varying the $\lambda$ exponent which describes the distribution. For the results presented in the main text, we held the number of sites at 5, scaled the environmental gradient from -1 to 1, and set the minimum and maximum body sizes to $0.0026$ and $1.2 *10^3$ respectively. Here, we plot the results of varying the number of sites (3, 10), increasing the scale of the environmental gradient (-100 to 100) and decreasing the range of body sizes (min = 1, max = 100). Generally, the results reported in the main manuscript are robust to changing these parameters: the MLE estimate is nearly always closer to the known parameters, and the variation in these estimates is usually smaller than the binning methods.

## Sample size, $n$

The number of observations in our simulations may bias the results. Therefore, we repeated the simulations described above, but varied the sample size $n$. We tested values of $n = 200, 500, 1000, 5000, 10 000$. Results of this analysis are presented in the Supplemental Information.

# Comparison with other published estimates

SI Table. This table shows published estimates of the variation in size spectra slopes (or exponents) in empirical studies. It is unclear how to directly compare estimates of the slope with different methods. However, the published estimates here range from ~0.1 to 0.2 across the gradients studied. For comparison, the 2.5-95% quantiles around the relationship estimate for the MLE method were ~0.1, whereas for the ELBn and NAS method they were ~0.25 and ~0.2, respectively. b_diff is the change in estimate (b-low - b-min). System refers to stream communities or mesocosm experiments. Method: MLE = maximum likelihod estimate, ELB = equal logarthmic binning, the number before indicates the number of bins used. The normalization process shifts the estimates by an absolute value of 1.0. Hence, direct comparison the relative change in normalized and non-normalized studies should not introduce any bias. The O'Gorman et al. 2017 study used average species size and abundance (Local Size Density Relationship, *sensu* White et al. 2007) as opposed to individual size distribution. These methods are related, but it is unclear how to directly compare estimates from each method. 

Supplementary table comparing with other published results will be submitted as a separate file for formatting.
