10/6 
changing analysis to have a more universal, elegant design

# 1 lambda estimates
lambda from -2.5 to -0.5, length.out = 9
*Density plots of lambda estimate, fill = method, known lambda as a dashed line
* lambda_hat ~ lambda --> see white et al. 2008 fig 2 and 3

# 2 sliding lambda window
three sets of lambdas [-2.5, -1.5], [-2, -1], [-1.5, -0.5]
* "main" regression plot, lambda_sets = rows ~ method = columns

# 3 changing relationship
one set of x [-1, 1], 3 sets of lambdas [-1.5], [-1.75, -1.25], [-2, -1]

# notes end of 10/6
make functions for different plots
load data objects, make ggplot.objects, stitch multi-panel figures together

Once functions made, plug them into simulation function

# Scripts
1_sim --> pull out SI
1b_window --> main analyses?
2b_ --> main plots
AMD/ NEON_estimate --> empirical
empirical plot --> stitch multi-panel
Delete everything else?
